# Gezinomi-Data-Analysis-Project

*This project was prepared for the Final Project within the Miuul Data Analyst Bootcamp.

 ##          --- Road map ---
## -In the first stage, importing the data from SQL server as csv.
## - Observing the data in a general table and detecting problems.
## -Turkish character problem detected.
## -Defining a function for Turkish characters.
## -Correction of Turkish characters with the Replace method.
## -Detection of duplicate data.
## -Duplicate columns are dropped from the data.
## -Detection of N/A data.
## -N/A populating the data with similar averages grouped in their own fields.
## -Detection of Unique cities in the data set and calculation of the frequencies of these cities.
## -Calculation of earned amounts based on total sales amounts and the Price variable on a city basis.
## -Determining sales and calculating total earnings according to concepts.
## -Calculation of the average Price of cities.
## -Creating a variable as Booking Type.
## -Classification according to the time difference between SaleDate and CheckInDate.
## -Recording these classified sales in BookingType.
## -Visualization of data according to different variables.
## -Saving DataFrames created with different variables as new csvs.
## -Saving separate csv files for each city.
## -(At this stage, the reason why we print and save different csvs is in the visualization stage and in different BI tools.
## - eases the burden of visualization with lower processing power when processing files.)
## -Testing the data set with LazyClassifier and LazyRegressor for a potential Machine Learning use.
## - Switching to visualization with Power BI.
